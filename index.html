            <h2>Health Beneffits of a Vegan Diet</h2>
            <p>
                Each day, more people are embracing a vegan, or plant-based, diet.

                According to a 2019 article in The Economist, 25% of 25- to 34-year-old Americans say they are vegans or
                vegetarians. And interest in veganism hit an all-time high in 2020, according to a report by the
                food-focused website Chef's Pencil.

                For some, shunning dairy, meat and other animal products may seem like an extreme sacrifice. For others,
                the personal and societal benefits associated with a vegan diet make the choice a no-brainer; for
                instance, many people care deeply about the welfare of animals. The potential health benefits alone
                inspire many to switch.

                But is a vegan diet really that healthy?

                Health benefits, when done right
                Jeffrey Soble, MD, a cardiologist at RUSH University Medical Center, began eating a plant-based diet
                nearly two year ago.

                Like others, improving his health — he has a family history of heart disease — played a significant role
                in that decision. Research has shown that a vegan diet can help do the following:

                Promote weight loss
                Reduce your risk of heart disease by lowering cholesterol levels
                Lower your chances of getting certain types of cancer, such as colon cancer
                Manage diabetes by lowering A1C levels
                But as Soble would tell any of his patients considering it themselves, going vegan doesn't automatically
                guarantee good health.

                "You can be overweight and be a vegan; you can be malnourished and be a vegan," Soble says. "Whatever
                your diet choice, you have to know which foods to avoid and which foods to seek out."

                The key: Planning
                "Refined grains, sweets and junk food are troublemakers for everyone, not just vegans," Soble cautions.
                "And vegans and nonvegans alike can fall into the habit of making these items the mainstays of their
                diet."

                To have a healthy diet of any kind, you need important nutrients. While many of these may have been
                plentiful when you ate dairy and meat, you'll need to find new ways to incorporate them into your diet
                as a vegan.

                Protein: Animals aren't the only sources of protein. Soy products (e.g., tofu and edamame) are also
                packed with protein. Other good sources include seitan (made from gluten), chickpeas, lentils and
                nutritional yeast.
                Vitamin B12: A lack of vitamin B12 can make you feel tired and weak. Getting enough vitamin B12, though,
                can be challenging for vegans because it can't be found in plants. To get your fill, stock up on
                fortified cereals, fortified rice and soy drinks — or take a supplement. The recommended daily amount
                for most adults is about 2.4 milligrams, but check with your doctor to see what's right for you.
                Essential fatty acids: A lack of essential fatty acids has been associated with problems related to
                brain heath, such as cognitive impairment and depression. To get your essential fatty acids, pile up the
                whole grains and leafy green vegetables (e.g., kale, spinach and collards). And try snacking on a small
                handful of unsalted nuts, like almonds, walnuts or pistachios (just watch your portions; nuts are high
                in calories).
                Iron: Red meat and egg yolks reign as the richest sources of iron. But they also are high in
                cholesterol. Good plant sources of iron include black-eyed peas, tofu and dried fruits (fresh fruit has
                iron, too, you just get more iron from dried fruit because you eat more).
                Vitamin D: Ten to 15 minutes of sunlight exposure a day can give you a vitamin D boost, as can fortified
                orange juice and soy.
